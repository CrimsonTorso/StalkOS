# StalkOS
A operating system for social engineering and cyber-stalking.

# About
This OS will be full of tools for social engineering and stalking for finding information on a certain target. It's an OS with similar software to a Linux hacking distro, but will consist of spear attacking tools and 'doxing' tools.

# Encryption methods
The encryption on this OS will be the best that I can acquire. Hopefully strong enough to halt bruteforce methods etc. I'll be setting-up a wipe method to change all data on the drive to 0-1 in binary, to completely wipe the data. This ensures the privacy and data is deleted.
